## Basic Knowledges
I refered to these materials:  
* [Bonwick94] Jeff Bonwick. _The Slab Allocator: An Object−Caching Kernel Memory Allocator._ Summer
1994 Usenix Conference, pp. 87−98. Available at http://www.usenix.org.
* [Gorman04] Mel Gorman. _Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager_.

And here is some review I wrote about the principle about Slab.
